# Covid-19-Detection-using-Deep-Neural-Network

The Corona outbreak has put significant pressure on imaging departments, to
test hundreds of peoples per day. Patients and doctors typically have to wait a
few hours to get the CT results, but our system is improving the CT diagnosis
speed for each case; and each minute saved is critical to decrease the chance of
cross-contamination at the hospital.

The system requires a user to upload a Lung CT Scan. The system then
processes the file and displays the images to the user. The user then chooses
which scan he or she wants to predict then the application pre-processes the
Lung CT Scan and infers the image to the predictive model. The output or prediction
of the model is then displayed to the user which will display Covid-
19 stage I,II and Severe stage or Non- Covid-19 to the User.
